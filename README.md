The first part of the assignment is to create a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second part is a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds. Then Monte Carlo simulations are run to project the portfolio performance at different time scales.
